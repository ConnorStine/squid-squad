# Squid Squad
This is a web-based game that follows a squid whose only goal is to paint. Unfortunately, he only has one color of ink! Help him find more colors to finish off his beautiful painting.

# About the Code
The program runs through HTML utilizing its eventlistener feature to allow for interaction between the user and the web application. The different buttons change the view and will appear and disappear based on user choices. The audio and visual components that require files reference them in the same directory as the .html file.

# Important
Due to certain browsers restricting the autoplay feature for different medias in an attempt to limit bandwidth usage, for the best experience please use Microsoft Edge. To ensure the web application functions correctly, make sure all files are in the same directory.

# Tips
You need to navigate the mazes that come up when pressing the mazes button. Once you make it through you can claim a new color by collecting the paint bucket, so make sure to press the picture button and lead the little squid to whichever field on his uncolored painting he wants to paint. There are 4 colors to find and 4 different things the squid wants to color! (He's gotta keep it simple for his first couple artistic ventures!)
